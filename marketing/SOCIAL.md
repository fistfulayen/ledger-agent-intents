### Main Launch Thread (Ian @iancr)

**Tweet 1/8 (Hook)**
```
I gave my AI agent access to my email.
Then my calendar.
Then my credit card.

We're building the largest honeypot in history.

Here's how I'm protecting myself 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/8 (The Problem)**
```
What you've given your agent:

• Your logins → your identity
• Your credit cards → your money
• Your passwords → your access
• Your personal data → your privacy

All in one system.

A system with bugs. Attack surfaces. Prompt injection vulnerabilities.

One breach = everything.
```

**Tweet 3/8 (The Uncomfortable Truth)**
```
"But my AI provider has security—"

Prompt injection bypasses safety measures weekly.
Third-party integrations introduce supply chain risks.
Social engineering works on AI (often better than humans).

Hoping they got security right is not a security model.
```

**Tweet 4/8 (The Lesson)**
```
We learned this with exchanges.

"Trust us with your keys" → Mt. Gox, FTX, etc.

The answer was self-custody.

Now we need to learn it again for agents.

Your AI shouldn't hold your keys. Your AI shouldn't hold your identity.
```

**Tweet 5/8 (The Solution)**
```
The solution: separate REQUEST from EXECUTE.

Agents propose. Humans approve. On hardware.

• Secure element — keys never exposed
• Trusted display — can't be spoofed
• Physical button — can't be automated

Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.
```

**Tweet 6/8 (How It Works)**
```
Agent runs:
→ ledger-intent send 50 USDC to 0x...

You see:
→ Full request in dashboard
→ Who, what, why, where

You decide:
→ Approve on Ledger (physical button)
→ Or reject (nothing happens)

30 seconds. Hardware guarantees.
```

**Tweet 7/8 (The Vision)**
```
This isn't just about payments.

Tomorrow it's:
• Identity verification
• Contract signing
• Access delegation
• Data sharing

Every sensitive operation in the agentic world needs this pattern.

We're building security infrastructure for the future.

### Punchy Single Tweets

**The Honeypot Tweet**
```
We're concentrating our logins, credit cards, passwords, and personal data in AI agents.

We're building the largest honeypot in history.

Hardware security is the only answer.

agentintents.io
```

**The Lesson Tweet**
```
Crypto lesson: "Trust us with your keys" → disaster

Agentic lesson: "Trust the AI with everything" → ???

Self-custody isn't just for coins anymore.

agentintents.io
```

**The Architecture Tweet**
```
Software security: can be bypassed, faked, exploited
Hardware security: secure element, trusted display, physical button

When your AI has access to everything, architecture matters.

Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.
```

**The Simple Tweet**
```
Your AI agent has your identity, your money, your access.

One breach = everything compromised.

Solution: agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.

Hardware security for the agentic era.

agentintents.io
```

**The Contrarian Tweet**
```
Hot take: AI agents are a security crisis waiting to happen.

We're giving them our logins, our credit cards, our data.

And trusting... what? Prompts? Terms of service?

I'll take hardware guarantees.

agentintents.io
```

**The Builder Tweet**
```
Built something for the agentic future:

Agent Payments with Ledger — your AI proposes transactions, you approve on Ledger hardware.

Secure element. Trusted display. Physical confirmation.

Because prompt injection + wallet access = very bad day.

```

### For Crypto Audience

**The "Not Your Keys" Tweet**
```
"Not your keys, not your coins" — we learned this

"Not your keys, not your agent's coins" — we need to learn this

Your AI should never hold signing authority.

Agent Payments with Ledger: hardware-secured transactions for the agentic era.

agentintents.io
```

**The Ledger Value Prop**
```
Ledger protects billions in crypto.

Same tech. New threat.

AI agents are the new attack surface.

Secure element + trusted display + physical confirmation = the only way to stay safe.

Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.
```

### For AI Audience

**The Safety Tweet**
```
We talk a lot about AI alignment.

What about AI security?

Your agent has access to your identity, money, and data.

One prompt injection away from disaster.

Hardware-in-the-loop isn't optional.

agentintents.io
```

**The Practical Tweet**
```
AI safety isn't just about alignment.

It's about architecture.

Agents shouldn't have signing authority.
Agents shouldn't hold credentials.
Agents shouldn't be trusted with irreversible actions.

Agents propose. Humans approve. On hardware.
```

### Hackathon Specific

**Pre-Submission**
```
Building for the @OpenClaw USDC Hackathon.

The judges are AI agents.

So I'm building what agents need: security infrastructure.

Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.

Let's see if the robots agree it matters.

agentintents.io
```

**Post-Submission**
```
Submitted to the USDC Hackathon on @moltbook.

Agent Payments with Ledger: hardware security for the agentic world.

Built for agent judges who understand:
• Prompt injection is real
• Security architecture matters
• Humans need to stay in control

### Main Launch Post

**We're building the largest honeypot in history. Here's how to protect yourself.**

I gave my AI agent access to my email last month. Then my calendar. Then my files. Last week, I gave it my credit card.

I'm not alone. Millions of people are doing the same thing. And we're creating an unprecedented security risk.

Think about what you've given your AI agent:
• Your logins (your identity)
• Your credit cards (your money)  
• Your passwords (your access)
• Your personal data (your privacy)

All concentrated in one system. A system that could have bugs. Could be compromised. Could suffer prompt injection. Could be socially engineered.

**One breach = everything compromised.**

The crypto community spent a decade learning "not your keys, not your coins." We watched trusted custodians fail spectacularly. The solution was self-custody—hardware wallets that keep private keys in secure elements, verified on trusted displays.

Now we need to apply that same architecture to the agentic world.

Today I'm releasing **Agent Payments with Ledger**, an open-source project that brings hardware security to AI agents.

The principle is simple: **Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.**

AI agents can request any transaction they want. But nothing moves without human approval on hardware—a secure element that never exposes keys, a trusted display that can't be spoofed, a physical button that no software can press.

This isn't about limiting what AI can do. It's about ensuring that when AI does sensitive things—spending money, verifying identity, signing contracts—humans stay in control.

We built this for the USDC OpenClaw Hackathon, where AI agents judge the submissions. Building for agents forced us to focus on what actually matters: security architecture that's sound, not security theater.

Try it: agentintents.io
Code: github.com/fistfulayen/ledger-agent-intents

The agentic era needs security infrastructure. This is a start.

### Shorter LinkedIn Post

**The question isn't whether AI agents will manage our digital lives. It's whether we'll maintain control.**

We're giving agents our logins, our credit cards, our data. It's convenient. It's also the largest honeypot in history.

Today I'm releasing Agent Payments with Ledger—open-source hardware security for the agentic era.

Agents propose, humans sign with Ledger.

Your AI can request anything. Only you can approve it—on a secure element with a trusted display and physical confirmation.

Because hoping your AI provider got security right is not a security model.

## Posts for Team Members

### For Ledger Engineers

```
Shipped something different.

Agent Payments with Ledger: transaction security for AI agents.

Architecture:
- Intent queue with audit trail
- React dashboard with Ledger Button (EIP-6963)
- CLI for any agent framework
- Hardware signing flow

The thesis: as agents get access to everything, hardware-in-the-loop becomes mandatory.

Built for the USDC Hackathon where AI judges the submissions. 🤖

```

### For AI/Security Engineers

```
The attack surface nobody's talking about: AI agent credentials.

We're concentrating logins, API keys, credit cards, and personal data in systems vulnerable to:
- Prompt injection
- Supply chain attacks
- Social engineering
- Plain old bugs

Agent Payments with Ledger: hardware-enforced approval for agent actions.

Intent queue → Human review → Ledger signing

Because defense in depth means not trusting any single software system.
